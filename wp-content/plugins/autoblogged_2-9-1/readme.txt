== Description ==

AutoBlogged automatically creates posts in your WordPress blog from any RSS or Atom feed. Use AutoBlogged to build an automated blog network, as a self-building video blog, to create topic portals, or aggregate RSS feeds. WP Autoblogs are a great way to quickly build keyword-dense content, earn money with your blog, and fully automate your blog posting.


== Installation ==

You can install AutoBlogged using the Add New Plugin page in the WordPress admin panel.

Alternatively you can upload it manually:

1. Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the wp-content/plugins/autoblogged directory of your WordPress installation. The path to autoblogged.php should be:
/wp-content/plugins/autoblogged/autoblogged.php

2. Activate AutoBlogged from the Plugins page.

For more information on installing plugins in WordPress, see http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins

== Upgrading ==
If you are upgrading AutoBlogged from a previous version, you simply upload the new files into the existing AutoBlogged directory. Upgrading will have no affect on your settings or feed configuration. If you have problems with the upgrade process, try removing any existing files before uploading.
